# Neon lanes
A simple 3d game I made as a part of learning Unity Engine and C#.


## How to Play
- Check out the latest release for the executable, note that its currently available only for windows x64
- Move one lane at a time by pressing left/right keys to avoid obstacles and reach the finish line
